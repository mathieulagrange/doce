Issues:

addition and removal of factors

implicit and explicit default values

multiple mask: ambiguity between factors and modality in array of array of mask

example:

  [[0], [1]] refers to
    1. one mask with first factor set to 0 and one mask with first factor set to 1
    or
    2. one mask with first factor set to 0 and second factor set to 1, equivalent to [0, 1] ?

  [[0, 1], [1, 0]] refers to
    1. one mask with first factor set to 0 and and second factor set to 1 one mask with first factor set to 1 and second factor set to 0
    or
    2. one mask with first factor set to 0 and 1 and second factor set to 0 and 1 ?

  answer: 1 always, that is an array of array is interpreted as an array of Mask

  If the second interpretation is needed, the solution is to add a -1, that is [[0, 1], [1, 0], -1] for the second example. Addition of the -1 is allowed even if it leads to a mask length larger than the number of factors
