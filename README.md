# DOCE: Design Of Computational Experiments
Doce is a python library designed to help you handling the complexity of computational experiments.

issues:

multiple experiments
  called experiment from stimuli
  main experiments

  facteur réservé experiment

solution:
  example with one experiment, explicitely called main

  if more than one, enforce specific naming of the 2 experiments and explain that the main experiment is now implicitely defined

  mask ?

  experiment|mask, if no pipe implicitely main

rename experiment with doce as doce defines a doce environnment

rename factor as experiment

a doce environnment is a set of experiments, data sinks, and environnment variables.

selector for export with sink selector considered also for display
