DOCE: Design Of Computational Experiments
=========================================

**Doce** is a python library designed to help you handling the complexity of computational experiments.

Experimentation and testing are a fundamental part of scientific research. They're also extremely time-consuming, tedious, and error-prone unless properly managed. **Doce** is here to help you with the management, running and reporting of your experiments, letting you focus more on the creative part of your research work.

What can **Doce** can help you to do?

 - Set up an experimental protocol once, and re-run it as often as needed with minimum hassle using new data, modified code, or alternative hypotheses.
 - Systematically explore many combinations of operational parameters in a system.
 - Re-use earlier results to only compute the later stages of a process, thus cutting down the running time.
 - Automatically produce analysis tables.  
 - Ease the production of paper-ready displays.
 - Keep experimental code, data and results organized in a standardized way, to ease cooperation with others and allow you to go back painlessly on months-old or years-old work.
