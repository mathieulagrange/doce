This section covers the fundamentals of developing with *doce*, including
a package overview, basic and advanced usage.  We will assume basic familiarity with Python and NumPy.


Overview
~~~~~~~~

The *doce* package is structured as collection of submodules that are each responsible for the important parts of managing a computational experiment:

  - doce

  - :ref:`doce.cli <cli>`
      Command-line interaction.
  - :ref:`doce.experiment <experiment>`
      Specify every aspects of the experiments from naming, storage location, plan, etc...
  - :ref:`doce.plan <plan>`
      Generate a number of settings by selecting factors and modalities of a given plan.
  - :ref:`doce.setting <setting>`
      Manipulate the settings generated by the plan.
  - :ref:`doce.metric <metric>`
      Manipulate and retrieve the output data.
  - :ref:`doce.util <util>`
      Utility functions.
